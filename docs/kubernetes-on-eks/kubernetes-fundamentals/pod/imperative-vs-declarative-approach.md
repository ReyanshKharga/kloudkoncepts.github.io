# Imperative vs Declarative Approach

Imperative approach describes `HOW` the program executes, while the declarative approach describes `WHAT` programs to be executed.

The imperative approach is good for learning and interactive experimentation (e.g. Python Interactive Shell)

The declarative approach is good for reproducible deployments and for production.

There are two ways to deploy to Kubernetes:

1. Imperatively, with the `kubectl` commands
2. Declaratively, by writing manifests and using `kubectl apply`
