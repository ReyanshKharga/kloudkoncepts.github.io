# Introduction to Argo CD

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery (CD) tool for kubernetes.


## What is GitOps?

GitOps uses Git repositories as a single source of truth to deliver infrastructure as code.

Basically, any changes in the infrastructure should be via code in the repository and that should be the source of truth.



## Why Argo CD?

Application deployment and lifecycle management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand. This is lacking in other CI/CD tools like AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, Jenkins etc.
