# Introduction to CLI Tools

To effectively operate within the Kubernetes and EKS environments, we require specific command-line interface (CLI) tools that facilitate the configuration and administration of resources in both EKS and Kubernetes. 

Now, let's look at the key CLI tools that will be using in this course.


## AWS CLI

The `AWS CLI` is a command-line tool that enables users to manage AWS services directly from the command line, offering a flexible and efficient way to create, configure, and interact with AWS resources.


## Eksctl

`Eksctl` is a command-line utility that streamlines the creation and management of Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS, making cluster administration more accessible and efficient.


## Kubectl

Using `kubectl`, individuals have the ability to create, alter, and remove Kubernetes resources like pods, deployments, services, and namespaces.


## Helm CLI

`Helm CLI` is a command-line tool that is used to interact with Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes. It is used to install, manage, and upgrade applications and services on Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts.
