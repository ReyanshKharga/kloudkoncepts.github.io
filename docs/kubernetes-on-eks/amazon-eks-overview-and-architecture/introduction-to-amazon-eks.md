# Introduction to Amazon EKS

## What is Amazon EKS?

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully-managed Kubernetes service offered by AWS.

It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS infrastructure.

With Amazon EKS, users can create Kubernetes clusters with just a few clicks, and easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on top of them.

EKS provides a highly-available and secure control plane for Kubernetes and automatically manages the scaling, patching, and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure.
