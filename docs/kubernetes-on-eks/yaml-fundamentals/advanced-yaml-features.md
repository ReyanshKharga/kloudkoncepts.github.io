# Advanced Features in YAML

Now that we have a good understanding of YAML, Data types in YAML, syntax etc.. let's look at some of the advanced features in YAML like multiline strings, anchor and aliases, extenstion and override.


Now that we're familiar with the basics of YAML, let's explore some advanced features like multiline strings, anchors and aliases, etc.


## Multiline String in YAML

In YAML, you can create a multiline string using the pipe character `|` or the greater than symbol `>`.


### Multiline String Using Greater Than Symbol

You can use `>` if you want the line breaks to be stripped out. You'll still have one line break at the end. You can use `>-` if you want to strip the line break at the end as well.

!!! tip
    You can use [YAML to JSON Converter Tool]{:target="_blank"} to see the resulting structure of the multiline string in YAML when it is parsed.

1. Multiline string using `>`:
    ```yaml
    # Using the greater than symbol
    multiline_string: >
      This is a 
      multiline 
      string 
      in YAML.
    ```

    YAML will treat the string as:

    ```yaml
    This is a multiline string in YAML.\n
    ```

2. Multiline string using `>-`:
    ```yaml
    # Using the greater than symbol
    multiline_string: >-
      This is a 
      multiline 
      string 
      in YAML.
    ```

    YAML will treat the string as:

    ```yaml
    This is a multiline string in YAML.
    ```

### Multiline String Using Pipe Character

You can use `|` if you want the line breaks to be preserved as `\n`. You can use `|-` if you want to strip the line break at the end.

1. Multiline string using `|`:
    ```yaml
    # Using the pipe character
    multiline_string: |
      This is a 
      multiline 
      string 
      in YAML.
    ```

    YAML will treat the string as:

    ```yaml
    This is a 
    multiline 
    string 
    in YAML.\n
    ```

2. Multiline string using `|-`:
    ```yaml
    # Using the pipe character
    multiline_string: |
      This is a 
      multiline 
      string 
      in YAML.
    ```

    YAML will treat the string as:

    ```yaml
    This is a 
    multiline 
    string 
    in YAML.
    ```


## Anchors and Aliases in YAML

YAML allows you to use `anchors` and `aliases` to create references to other parts of the document. This can be useful for avoiding repetition and simplifying complex structures.


### Anchor

An `anchor` is a name assigned to a specific value in the YAML document. It's indicated using the `&` character followed by the `anchor` name. For example:

```yaml
# Define an anchor for a list of values
list: &my_list
  - apple
  - banana
  - mango
```

In this example, the anchor name is `my_list` and it refers to the list of values `["apple", "banana", "mango"]`.

### Alias

An `alias` is a reference to an anchor in the YAML document. It's indicated using the `*` character followed by the `anchor` name. For example:

```yaml
# Use an alias to reference the list of values
fruits: *my_list
```

In this example, the `fruits` list contains an `alias` to the `my_list` anchor. When this YAML document is parsed, the `alias` will be replaced with the corresponding `anchor` value, resulting in the following list:

```yaml
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
```

### Using Anchor and Alias

Here's an example document that uses `anchor` and `alias`:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `my-document.yml`"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    list: &my_list
      - apple
      - banana
      - mango

    fruits: *my_list
    ```

The above YAML is equivalent to the following YAML document:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `my-equivalent-document.yml`"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    list:
      - apple
      - banana
      - mango

    fruits:
      - apple
      - banana
      - mango
    ```

!!! tip
    You can covert the first document to JSON and then convert the resulting JSON back to YAML to see if they are actually equivalent.
