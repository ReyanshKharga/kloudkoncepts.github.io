# Amazon EKS Masterclass: Kubernetes and Microservices on EKS

Master Kubernetes, Microservices, Logging, Monitoring, Service Mesh, DevOps, CI/CD, GitOps, and Go From Zero to Hero!


## What Will You Lean in This Course?

|            |            |
|------------|------------|
| :material-check-all: You will be able to confidently write Kubernetes manifests for any kind of application and set up ci/cd pipeline to deploy it on EKS along with Logging, Monitoring and Service Mesh.  | :material-check-all: You will learn how to set up and configure popular tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Istio, Kiali, Jaegar, Argo CD etc. You will also set up CI/CD using DevOps.  |
| 1. You will learn Docker fundamentals. In this section you'll learn how to write Dockerfile for an application, create Docker image and run containers.  | 2. You will acquire an understanding of the Kubernetes Components and Cluster Architecture, which will serve as a solid foundation for this course.  |
| 3. You will learn YAML fundamentals and its importance in Kubernetes. | 4. You will create Amazon EKS cluster using both the eksctl command line and config files. |
| 5. You will gain clarity on the difference between imperative and declarative approaches. | 6. You will learn Kubernetes fundamentals (Namespace, Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service, etc.) |
|7. You will learn advanced concepts in Kubernetes (Probes, Init-Containers, ConfigMap, Secrets, Requests and Limits, Service Quota, etc.) | 8. You will learn about Storage in Kubernetes, Persistent Volume, PersistentVolume Claim and EBS CSI Driver to manage Amazon EBS in EKS. |
| 9. You will add private nodegroup in EKS cluster and delete the public nodegroup. | 10. You will learn about the LoadBalancer service type in detail; Both, the classic load balancer (CLB) and network load balancer (NLB). |
| 11. You will learn about Kubernetes Service Account and IAM Role for Service Account. | 12. You will deploy AWS Load Balancer Controller formerly known as AWS ALB Ingress Controller. |
| 13. You will learn about Kubernetes Ingress resource in detail. (Instance/IP mode, Health Check, SSL, SSL Redirect, SSL self discovery, internal alb, etc.) | 14. You will deploy External DNS in Kubernetes to automatically manage DNS records in Route53. |
| 15. You will learn how to create NLB using AWS Load Balancer Controller. | 16. You will deploy Metrics Server to monitor Kubernetes resource utilization.|
| 17. You will learn how to set up EKS cluster autoscaling, horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA), and vertical pod autoscaling (VPA). | 18. You will learn how to use EKS with ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry). |
| 19. You will learn about the Microservice architecture and deploy a simple 3-tier application following the Microservice architecture. | 20. You will learn how to set up Logging for your EKS cluster and applications using Fluent Bit and CloudWatch. |
| 21. You will learn how to set up Monitoring for your EKS cluster and applications using Prometheus and Grafana open-source tools. | 22. You will learn about Istio Service Mesh and its architecture. |
| 23. You will learn about Gateways, Virtual services, and Destination rules in Istio traffic management. | 24. You will deploy Kiali and Jaegar monitoring tools for observability and distributed tracing. |
| 25. You will deploy a meshed microservices architecture consisting of 3 microservices. | 26. You will reconfigure Istio to deploy Application Load Balancer instead of Classic Load Balancer. |
| 27. You lean about Istio traffic routing features (Traffic Splitting, Canary Deployment, Fault Injection, Circuit Breaker, Retry Strategy). | 28. You will set up CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy. |
| 29. You will set up Argo CD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. | 30. You will set up continuous deployment using Argo CD. |
| 31. You will learn about Helm Charts, and some other advanced Kubernetes concepts. | 32. You will learn about EKS fargate profiles, Amazon VPC CNI and many other topics. |
