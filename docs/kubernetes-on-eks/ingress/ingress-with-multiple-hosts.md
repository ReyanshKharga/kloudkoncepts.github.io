# Create Ingress With Multiple Hosts

You can use the `host` field to match the host in the rules. A listener rule will be created for each of the hosts defined in ingress rules.


## Prerequisite

To follow this tutorial, you'll require a domain and, additionally, an SSL certificate for the domain and its subdomains.

1. Register a Route 53 Domain

    Go to AWS Console and register a Route 53 domain. You can opt for a cheaper TLD (top level domain) such as `.link`

    !!! note
        It usually takes about 10 minutes but it might take about an hour for the registered domain to become available.

2. Request a Public Certificate

    Visit AWS Certificate Manager in AWS Console and request a public certificate for your domain and all the subdomains. For example, if you registered for a domain `example.com` then request certificate for `example.com` and `*.example.com`

    !!! note
        Make sure you request the certificate in the region where your EKS cluster is in.

3. Validate the Certificate

    Validate the requested certificate by adding `CNAME` records in Route 53. It is a very simple process. Go to the certificate you created and click on `Create records in Route 53`. The `CNAMEs` will be automatically added to Route 53.

    !!! note
        It usually takes about 5 minutes but it might take about an hour for the certificate to be ready for use.


Now that you have everything you need, let's move on to the demonstration.


## Docker Images

Here are the Docker Images used in this tutorial:

- [reyanshkharga/reactapp:v1]{:target="_blank"}
- [reyanshkharga/nodeapp:v1]{:target="_blank"}

!!! note
    [reyanshkharga/nodeapp:v1]{:target="_blank"} runs on port `5000` and has the following routes:

    - `GET /` Returns host info and app version
    - `GET /health` Returns health status of the app
    - `GET /random` Returns a randomly generated number between 1 and 10

    [reyanshkharga/reactapp:v1]{:target="_blank"} is a frontend app that runs on port `3000`.


## Objective

In this example we will have 2 microservices:

1. `backend`: uses docker image `reyanshkharga/nodeapp:v1`
2. `frontend`: uses docker image `reyanshkharga/reactapp:v1`

We'll do the following:

1. Create a deployment and service for `backend` microservice.
2. Create a deployment and service for `frontend` microservice.
3. Create a ingress that sends traffic to one of the microservices based on the host.
4. We'll also provide separate health check path for each microservie using `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path` annotation in the service definition of each microservice.


## Step 1: Create Kubernetes Objects

Let's create the kubernetes objects as discussed above:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `backend.yml`"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    # Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: backend-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: backend
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: backend
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: backend-container
            image: reyanshkharga/nodeapp:v1
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            ports:
              - containerPort: 5000
    # Service
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: backend-nodeport-service
      annotations:
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /health
    spec:
      type: NodePort
      selector:
        app: backend
      ports:
        - port: 5000
          targetPort: 5000
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `frontend.yml`"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    # Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: frontend-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: frontend
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: frontend-container
            image: reyanshkharga/reactapp:v1
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            ports:
              - containerPort: 3000
    # Service
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: frontend-nodeport-service
      annotations:
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /
    spec:
      type: NodePort
      selector:
        app: frontend
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          targetPort: 3000
    ```

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: `ingress.yml`"

    ```yaml linenums="1"
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: my-ingress
      annotations:
        # Load Balancer Annotations
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing # Default value is internal
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags: Environment=dev,Team=DevOps # Optional
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-name: my-load-balancer # Optional
        # Health Check Annotations
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-protocol: HTTP
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-port: traffic-port
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /health
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-interval-seconds: '5'
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-timeout-seconds: '2'
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/success-codes: '200'
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthy-threshold-count: '2'
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/unhealthy-threshold-count: '2'
        # SSL Annotations
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-policy: ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08 # Optional
        # Listerner Ports Annotation
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTP": 80}, {"HTTPS": 443}]'
        # SSL Redicrect Annotation
        alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: '443'
    spec:
      ingressClassName: alb
      rules:
      - host: api.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: backend-nodeport-service
                port:
                  number: 5000
      - host: app.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend-nodeport-service
                port:
                  number: 3000
    ```

Observe the following:

1. We've provided the health check paths for each of the microservices using the `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path` annotation.
2. In the ingress, we have used `host` in the rules to route traffic to a particular microservice based on matching host.
3. We haven't provided `certificate-arn` because SSL discovery would work via host.

Assuming your folder structure looks like the one below:

```
|-- manifests
│   |-- backend.yml
│   |-- frontend.yml
│   |-- ingress.yml
```

Let's apply the manifests to create the kubernetes objects:

```
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

This will create the following resources:

- Deployment and service for `backend` microservice.
- Deployment and service for `frontend` microservice.
- Ingress with two rules.


## Step 2: Verify Kubernetes Objects

```
# List pods
kubectl get pods

# List deployments
kubectl get deployments

# List services
kubectl get svc

# List ingress
kubectl get ingress
```

Also, go to the AWS Console and verify the resources created by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, including the load balancer, target groups, listener rules, etc.

Pay close attention to the listener rules that were created. You will notice that, based on the host header, traffic is directed to a particular microservice.


## Step 3: Add Records in Route 53

Go to AWS Route 53 and add two `A` records (`api.example.com` and `app.example.com`) that points to the load balancer that was created. You can use alias to point the subdomain to the load balancer.


## Step 4: Access App Using Route 53 DNS

Once the load balancer is in `Active` state, you can hit the subdomains you created in Route 53 and verify if everything is working properly.

Try accessing the following hosts:

```
# Backend
https://api.example.com

# Frontend
https://app.example.com
```

Also, verify that `HTTP` is redirected to `HTTPS`.



## Clean Up

Assuming your folder structure looks like the one below:

```
|-- manifests
│   |-- backend.yml
│   |-- frontend.yml
│   |-- ingress.yml
```

Let's delete all the resources we created:

```
kubectl delete -f manifests/
```

Also, go to Route 53 and delete the `A` records that you created.
